# Renovate

Renovate is a tool (Github app) for automating dependency updates - see
https://dsbno.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SW/pages/4257644545/Renovate

The file `renovate.json` in this repo will tell Renovate where to fetch its centralized configuration.

Renovate is configured to inspect all new repos in the dsb-norge github org. If an onboarding PR is not created automatically,
check that configuration.
